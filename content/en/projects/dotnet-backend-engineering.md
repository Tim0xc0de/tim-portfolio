**Timeline:** 2023 - Present · **Category:** 💼 Professional

Since 2023, a major focus of my work has been maintaining, modernizing, and improving existing .NET backend systems used in production environments.

This ongoing work represents the core of my professional experience in backend development.

This includes upgrading legacy applications, consolidating services, improving maintainability, and automating recurring backend processes.

The work spans API development, database refactoring, job automation, monitoring, and system modernization while continuously improving code structure and modularity.

## Core Responsibilities

- Upgrading applications to modern .NET versions
- Refactoring legacy utilities and backend services
- Consolidating standalone tools into centralized services
- Improving deployment and maintenance workflows
- Automating recurring backend tasks
- Improving logging and system observability
- Increasing modularity and maintainability of codebases

## Modular Architecture & Code Structure

A strong focus during modernization work was improving code structure and modularity to make systems easier to maintain and extend.

**Key improvements:**
- Separation of concerns across application layers
- Modular service and data access components
- Dependency Injection usage across services
- Reusable service abstractions
- Reduction of tightly coupled components
- Easier feature extensions and testing possibilities

Many utilities were refactored to follow structured backend patterns instead of monolithic logic.

## MVC & Backend Design Patterns

Several applications followed or were migrated towards MVC and structured backend patterns.

**Work included:**
- Controller-based request handling
- Separation of business logic into services
- Repository or data-access abstraction layers
- Clean separation between UI, logic, and data layers
- Improved routing and API endpoint structure

These changes improved maintainability and reduced side effects between application components.

## Utility Consolidation & Job Automation

One major task involved handling more than 30 standalone utilities that previously ran independently.

To improve maintainability and monitoring, these utilities were consolidated into a centralized backend service.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Creation of a centralized microservice
- Job execution handled via Hangfire
- Scheduled and background tasks unified
- Database logging added for job monitoring
- Failure tracking and retry handling
- Removal of manual execution processes

This significantly improved transparency and maintenance.

## Technology & Stack Experience

- Runtime behavior analysis

**Modernization & Refactoring**
- Migration of applications to newer .NET versions
- Dependency cleanup and modernization
- Refactoring legacy code structures
- Improving maintainability of utilities
- Removal of obsolete components

## Development Impact

The modernization and consolidation work resulted in:

- Reduced operational complexity
- Improved reliability of background processes
- Easier monitoring of system jobs
- Simplified deployment workflows
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Better structured and extensible systems

## Learnings

- Handling legacy systems pragmatically
- Incrementally modernizing production software
