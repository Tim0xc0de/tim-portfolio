**Timeline:** 2023 - Present · **Category:** 💼 Professional

Since 2023, a central focus of my work has been on the maintenance, modernization, and continuous improvement of existing .NET backend systems in critical production environments. This area represents the core of my experience in software development: The transformation of grown legacy structures into modern, modular architectures.

## Core Tasks & Focus
My work encompasses the entire lifecycle of system maintenance – from troubleshooting in ongoing operations to strategic architectural realignment:
* **Version Upgrades:** Migration of applications to modern frameworks (up to .NET 9).
* **Refactoring:** Transformation of monolithic legacy utilities into maintainable backend services.
* **Consolidation:** Merging isolated standalone tools into centralized services.
* **Observability:** Implementation of enhanced logging and monitoring for error diagnosis.
* **Automation:** Reduction of manual processes through intelligent background workflows.

## Modular Architecture & Code Quality
A significant part of the modernization was the transition to clean architecture patterns. To make systems extensible, I established the following principles:

* **Separation of Concerns:** Consistent separation of application layers.
* **Dependency Injection (DI):** Complete decoupling of services across all levels.
* **Service Abstraction:** Introduction of reusable components instead of tightly coupled logic.
* **MVC & Repository Patterns:** Migration towards structured data access and processing structures to minimize side effects.

## Utility Consolidation & Job Automation
One of the biggest challenges was managing numerous standalone utilities that previously ran independently and without transparency.

### The Solution: Centralized Backend Service
To massively improve maintainability and monitoring, these tools were transferred into a central microservice:
* **Centralized Execution:** Bundling all logic in a stable service.
* **Hangfire Integration:** Implementation of robust background processing for scheduled tasks.
* **Job Monitoring:** Introduction of database-based logging, error tracking, and automated retry strategies.
* **Result:** Full transparency over all background processes and significant reduction of manual maintenance effort.

## Technology & Stack
My technical focus lies on the efficient use of the modern .NET ecosystem:

* **Frameworks:** .NET 9, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core.
* **APIs:** RESTful design, JSON communication, OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
* **Automation:** Hangfire for background processing and complex workflows.
* **Database:** SQL Server (query optimization, refactoring, schema modernization).
* **Monitoring:** Centralized logging with NLog and runtime behavior analysis.

## Impact & Results
The targeted modernization work led to measurable improvements in the system landscape:
1. **Reduced Complexity:** Fewer error sources through consolidation.
2. **Higher Reliability:** Stable background processes through professional job handling.
3. **Faster Deployments:** Simplified CI/CD workflows through modernized project structures.
4. **Future-Proofing:** A codebase ready for .NET 10 and upcoming requirements.

## Current Direction
I continue to pursue the goal of making backend structures even more modular and eliminating repetitive tasks through intelligent automation. The focus is always on a pragmatic but sustainable approach to existing production software.
