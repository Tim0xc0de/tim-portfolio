description: "Backend Developer - .NET, APIs, Modernization"
---

I am a software developer focused on backend development, system architecture, and modern web technologies. I enjoy building structured, scalable systems and exploring how software connects with real-world automation and intelligent systems.

My work spans from enterprise backend services to experimental AI-driven applications and industrial automation projects.

## Technical Background

**..NET Development**

My primary focus is modern .NET backend development, including:

- Microservice architecture design
- REST API development (JSON / OpenAPI / YAML)
- Entity Framework & database modeling
- Modular system design and MVC architecture
- Background job systems using Hangfire
- Logging and monitoring with NLog
- Migration and modernization of legacy systems to .NET 9
- Integration of multiple utilities into unified services

I have worked on consolidating over 30 independent backend utilities into a centralized microservice architecture with automated job scheduling and database-based monitoring.

## Personal Projects

**HandwerkerAI**

A private experimental AI platform for tradespeople built with Next.js and TypeScript.

Features include:

- Offer and invoice generation
- Customer database management
- Authentication system
- AI-powered email responses (using Claude)
- Modular frontend architecture
- API-driven backend structure

The project served as a playground for exploring AI integration, system architecture, and product design.

**Robotics & Computer Vision Project**

As part of my professional training in Industry 4.0 and digitalization, I am developing an automated quality inspection system using:

- Python & FastAPI
- OpenCV computer vision
- REST APIs
- Industrial robotics
- SQLite data logging

The system uses a robotic arm to inspect manufactured components via camera-based analysis and automated sorting.

## Education

I am currently completing advanced professional training in digitalization and Industry 4.0 at DQR 6 level (comparable to Bachelor degree).

My studies include:

- Python programming
- Sensor technology
- PLC programming
- Microcontrollers
- Robotics and automation
- MQTT communication
- Networking fundamentals
- Cybersecurity basics
- AI fundamentals

My final project focuses on automated robotic quality inspection using computer vision and API-driven system architecture.

## Certifications

**IT Specialist in Application Development** (2020 - 2023)  
Completed vocational training in software development

**AdA Certificate** (2024)  
Ausbildung der Ausbilder (Training the Trainer)

**Archer Admin 1** (2024)  
Official Archer administration certification

## Professional Experience

In my professional work I support enterprise system administration and integrations using Archer, focusing on application maintenance, data synchronization, and operational reliability.

I also work on .NET backend modernization, migrating legacy systems, and building scalable microservice architectures.

## Private

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies such as AI, VR, and modern software architectures. I like experimenting with new frameworks, building side projects, and continuously expanding my technical skill set.

I am driven by curiosity and the desire to understand how complex systems work — from backend services to robotics and intelligent automation.

## Goals

My long-term goal is to grow into a highly skilled software engineer who can design and build robust systems that bridge software, automation, and intelligent technologies.

I am especially interested in backend architecture, AI-driven applications, and the intersection of software engineering with real-world systems.
