# About

**Backend Developer | .NET Specialist | State-Certified Technician in Training**

I am a software developer with a passion for structured, scalable backend systems and modern web technologies. My focus is on translating complex business logic into clean code and bridging the gap between traditional software development and intelligent, automated systems.

My expertise ranges from enterprise backend services in the .NET ecosystem to projects in AI integration and industrial automation.

## 🛠 Technical Focus

### .NET Development & Architecture
At the core of my daily work is modern **.NET backend development**. I accompany systems throughout their entire lifecycle – from conception to production maintenance:

* **Architecture:** Design of microservices and modular system landscapes (MVC).
* **API Design:** Development of robust REST APIs (OpenAPI / YAML).
* **Modernization:** Migration of legacy systems to **.NET 9**.
* **Automation:** Implementation of background job systems with **Hangfire**.
* **Data & Monitoring:** Entity Framework Core, SQL modeling, and logging with **NLog**.

A key focus of my experience lies in **consolidating numerous independent backend utilities** into a centralized, maintainable microservice architecture with automated monitoring.

## 🚀 Projects & Innovation

### HandwerkerAI (Private Fullstack Project)
An experimental AI-powered business platform for tradespeople, built with **Next.js and TypeScript** as a private playground for exploring modern technologies.
* **AI Integration:** Automated offer and response generation via Claude API.
* **Architecture:** Focus on modular frontend design and an API-driven backend structure.
* **Purpose:** Experimental project for exploring AI integration, system architecture, and product design.

### Robotics & Computer Vision
As part of my state-certified technician training, I am developing a system for automated quality inspection:
* **Stack:** Python, FastAPI, OpenCV, and SQLite.
* **Hardware:** Integration of industrial robotics for camera-based analysis and automated sorting of components via REST interfaces.

## 🎯 Goals & Interests

My goal is to design systems as a software engineer that are not just code, but intelligently automate real-world processes. I am particularly interested in the intersection of **backend architecture, AI-driven applications, and physical systems**.

Outside of coding, I find balance through **sports at the gym** or enjoying a good movie at the **cinema**. This balance helps me approach complex technical challenges with fresh focus.
